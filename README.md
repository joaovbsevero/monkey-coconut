# Donkey Kong

Base project to develop [monkey-coconut problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_monkey_and_the_coconuts), which is:

Five men and a monkey were shipwrecked on an island. They spent the first-day gathering coconuts. During the night, one man woke up and decided to take his share of the coconuts. He divided them into five piles. One coconut was leftover so he gave it to the monkey, then hid his share and went back to sleep.

Soon a second man woke up and did the same thing. After dividing the coconuts into five piles, one coconut was leftover which he gave to the monkey. He then hid his share and went back to bed. The third, fourth, and fifth man followed exactly the same procedure. The next morning, after they all woke up, they divided the remaining coconuts into five equal shares. This time also 1 coconut was left. What is the smallest number of coconuts that could have been there in the original pile?

## Usage

The resources folder has different files in increasing size, meaning that the first file will be the smallest and fastest scenario, and the last will be the biggest and slowest scenario. To run the program simply executes the following command:


```sh
cargo run --release -- resources/<replace-with-your-case>.txt
# Example
# cargo run --release -- resources/1000.txt
```
